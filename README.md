# FYP-2024---Ground-Classification-System
Ground Type Classification System for Automated Selection of Tunnel Boring Machines

Dear User,
The purpose of the following code is to determine the suitable TBM for the ground type present on your project site. The scope has been limited to only focus on EPB and Mixed Shield TBM's for soft and heterogeneous ground conditions, respectively. 
In order for the program to run smoothly, ensure the provided excel template is filled with relevant information:
1. Mass retained on each seive size,
2. Liquid Limit and Plasticity Index,
3. Permeability, Consistency, Relative Density, Confinment Pressure, Swelling Potential, Abrasivity

It should be noted that results should still be analysied carefully by hand to ensure the correct selection of TBM based on the ground conditions present on site.
