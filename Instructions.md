Ground Type Classification System for Automated Selection of Tunnel Boring Machines

Dear User,
The purpose of the following code is to determine the most suitable TBM for the ground type present on your project site. Due to limitations, only EPB and Mixed Shield TBM's are able to be selected for either soft and heterogeneous ground conditions, respectively. 

Please begin by downloading the Test Case - Tempaplate.xlsx file and filling in the data from your laboratory results. These results include: 
1. Mass retained on each seive size,
2. Liquid Limit and Plasticity Index,
3. Permeability, Consistency Index, Relative Density, Confinment Pressure, Swell Index, Abrasivity values. Please ensure the rows direclty underneath these specific titles are either Yes or No to indicate whether you are including them

Once the you have finished filling in your excel file, please rename to the following "GCS-LR.xlsx", and save to your device.
